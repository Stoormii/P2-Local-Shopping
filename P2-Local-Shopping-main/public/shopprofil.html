                    <dt>The idea of Athena Jewelry was founded in 1991 when Niki began selling and exporting 
                        jewelry to leading goldsmiths in Denmark while living and working in Greece.</dt> 
                    <dt>The family business has, for over two decades, built a strong reputation as a trendsetting 
                        brand with a focus on high quality and innovative design ‚Äì not only in Denmark but also in 
                        Scandinavia and many other parts of Europe. When Niki Komselis returned home after many 
                        years as a designer and producer abroad to fulfill her dream and live her passion for 
                        the magical world of jewelry and gemstones, Athena Jewelry in Aalborg became a reality.
                        Niki, together with her mother Birte Komselis, purchased the small shop in connection 
                        with the family restaurant </dt>
